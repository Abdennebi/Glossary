# 51% attack (aka Consensus HiJacking)

A theoretical situation where a single miner or group of miners controls
more than half of the networks computing power and decides to use this
power to their advantage. The attacker can double spend his money â€“
meaning he can pay with the same Bitcoin twice or even more. The attacker
will also be able to prevent transactions from being confirmed and prevent
other miners from generating new Bitcoins.
