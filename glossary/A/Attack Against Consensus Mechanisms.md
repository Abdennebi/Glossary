# Attack Against Consensus Mechanisms

A number of attacks can be made against the consensus mechanism used by a Blockchain/DLT. The classic attack is of course to get enough resources to mount a 51% attack (please note that this percentage varies, e.g. in Byzantine Fault Tolerance based networks 34% is usually sufficient), in simple terms this means getting enough computational power, or proof of stake or whatever resource the consensus mechanism relies upon to control the data being written to the Blockchain/DLT.

It should also be noted that based on the consensus model being used the 51% attack provides a high probability of success, attackers can mount the attack with less resources but they are less likely to succeed.

Additionally there are attacks that can aid in reducing the complexity and resources needed to mount a 51% attack, for example by knocking large miners or mining pools offline the attacker can reduce the amount of computational resources they would need to mount a 51% attack.
