# Segregated Witness (Segwit)

is where data, or more specifically data related to signatures are removed
from bitcoin transactions making them smaller in size. This in turn makes
the blocks smaller meaning more transactions can be included in a block.
Technically, "Segregated witness (Segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will
allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction
signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is
covered by the txid."
