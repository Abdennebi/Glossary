# SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)

Simplified Payment Verification. A Bitcoin protocol feature that is usually
implemented in wallets. It allows the creation of "lightweight" wallet clients
- wallets that donâ€™t need to download the whole blockchain in order to
operate. This makes it possible to install SPV wallets on mobile phones and
other space limited devices.
