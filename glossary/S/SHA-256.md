# SHA-256

The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is one of a number of cryptographic hash
functions. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a text or a data file.
SHA-256 algorithm generates an almost-unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte)
hash. Hash is a one way function â€“ it cannot be decrypted back. This makes it
suitable for password validation, challenge hash authentication, anti-tamper,
digital signatures. SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1,
and is one of the strongest hash functions available.
