# Shared Ledger

The shared ledger is the single source of truth, or the entire history of
validated transactions, on a blockchain network. Any discrepancies in the
shared ledger across nodes are resolved through consensus. The ledger has
the following attributes:
* It records all validated transactions on the network.
* It is shared across all network participants.
* It is replicated, so that each participant has their own copy.
* It is permissioned, so that participants can only view their own transactions.
