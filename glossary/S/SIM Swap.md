# SIM Swap

A SIM Swap is an attack where an attacker tricks a phone company (via phishing, credential theft, social engineering, etc.) into swaping a SIM or porting a phone number to a device controlled by the attacker allowing them top hijack that phone number and receive and make calls/SMS texts and so on as that number. This is most commonly used when targeting systems using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS
