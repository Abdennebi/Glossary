# Simple Payment Verification (SPV)

is a technique described in Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s paper. SPV allows a
lightweight client to verify that a transaction is included in the Bitcoin
blockchain, without downloading the entire blockchain. The SPV client only
needs download the block headers, which are much smaller than the full
blocks. To verify that a transaction is in a block, a SPV client requests a proof
of inclusion, in the form of a Merkle branch.
