# Smart Contract

(also called self-executing contracts, blockchain contracts, or digital
contracts) are simply computer programs that act as agreements where
the terms of the agreement can be preprogrammed with the ability to self-execute and self-enforce itself. The main goal of a smart contract is to enable
two anonymous parties to trade and do business with each other, usually
over the internet, without the need for a middleman. The origin and history
of smart contracts is much older than bitcoin and dates back to the 1990’s.
The term ‘smart contract’ was first coined in 1993 by one of bitcoin’s alleged
creators, Nick Szabo, and referred to self-automated computer programs
that can carry out the terms of any contract.
