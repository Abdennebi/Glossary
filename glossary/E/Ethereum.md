# Ethereum

Ethereum is a programmable open blockchain. Rather than give users a set
of predefined operations (e.g. bitcoin transactions), Ethereum allows users
to create their own operations of any complexity they wish. In this way, it
serves as a platform for many different types of decentralized blockchain
applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies. At the heart
of it is the Ethereum Virtual Machine ("EVM"), which can execute code of
arbitrary algorithmic complexity. In computer science terms, Ethereum is
"Turing complete". Developers can create applications that run on the EVM
using friendly programming languages modelled on existing languages like
JavaScript and Python.
