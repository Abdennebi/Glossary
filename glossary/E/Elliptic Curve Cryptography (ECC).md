# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can
be used to create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys.
ECC generates keys through the properties of the elliptic curve equation
instead of the traditional method of generation as the product of very large
prime numbers.
