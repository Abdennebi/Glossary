# HardFork

A permanent divergence in the blockchain, commonly occurs when nonupgraded nodes canâ€™t validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow
newer consensus rules. A hardfork is a change to the blockchain protocol that
makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all
users to upgrade their clients. The most recent example of a hardfork in public
blockchains is the Ethereum hardfork which happened on July 21st 2016.
The hardfork changed the Ethereum protocol, therefore second blockchain
emerged (Ethereum Classic, ETC) which supports the old Ethereum protocol.
In order to continue existing ETC needs miners, which would validate the
transactions on the blockchain.
