# Nakamoto Consensus

is the decentralized mechanism for emergent consensus. Emergent, because
consensus is not achieved explicitlyâ€”there is no election or fixed moment
when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent artifact of the
asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all following
simple rules. Decentralized consensus emerges from the interplay of four
processes that occur independently on nodes across the network:

* Independent verification of each transaction, by every full node, based on a comprehensive list of criteria
* Independent aggregation of those transactions into new blocks by mining nodes, coupled with demonstrated computation through a proof-of-work algorithm
* Independent verification of the new blocks by every node and assembly into a chain
* Independent selection, by every node, of the chain with the most cumulative computation demonstrated through proof of work
