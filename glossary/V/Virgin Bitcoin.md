# Virgin Bitcoin

All bitcoins start out as virgins, and stay that way until the second they are
moved to another address. When new bitcoins are mined, they are noted on
the blockchain in the first transaction in a block. This is called the coinbase
transaction, (nothing to do with the popular bitcoin wallet coinbase). These
bitcoins are always created by a miner, and they include a single coinbase (or
coinbase field) as the sole input for coinbase transactions. The purpose of the
coinbase is to allow the miner who solved the block to claim the block reward,
which is currently 12.5 bitcoins.
