# Validating Peer

A network node that runs the consensus protocol for the network to validate
transactions and maintain the ledger. Validated transactions are appended
to the ledger, in blocks. If a transaction fails consensus, it is purged from
the block and therefore, not written to the ledger. A validating peer (VP) has
authority to deploy, invoke and query chaincode.
