# Chaincode Services

Chaincode Services provides a secure and lightweight method to sandbox
chaincode execution on the validating nodes. The environment is a "locked
down" and secured container, along with a set of signed base images
containing secure OS and chaincode language, runtime and SDK layers for Go,
Java and Node.js. Additional languages can be enabled, if required.
