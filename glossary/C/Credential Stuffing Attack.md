# Credential Stuffing Attack

In simple terms a credential stuffing attack is when an attacker gains access to a list of passwords and then tries them (usually in a brute force manner) against a protected resource such as an Exchange account or a wallet. This attack succeeds more often than it should due to password reuse.
