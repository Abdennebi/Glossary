# Chaincode Standard Transaction Types

The standard transaction types are as follows:
1. Init () - when you first deploy your chaincode. This should be used to initialize your chaincode.
2. Invoke () - when you want to call chaincode functions to do real work
3. Query () - whenever you query your chaincode’s state.
4. Main () – when it’s time to setup the communication between the chaincode & the peer that deployed it.
