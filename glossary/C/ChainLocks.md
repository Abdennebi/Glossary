# ChainLocks

ChainLocks is a defensive mechanism that helps prevent 51% Attacks by having the network vote on the "first seen" block, if enough of the network votes for a given block it is accepted. This done by using special Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs) nodes and thus prevents an attacker from showing up with a pre-mined chain (their blocks would not have been previously seen and voted on).
