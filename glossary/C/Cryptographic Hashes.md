# Cryptographic Hashes

such as the SHA256 computational algorithm, produce a fixed-size, unique
hash value, known as a digest, from variable-sized transaction input. Hashes
feature a mathematical property in which a hash can be arrived at uniquely
from a given input, but the input cannot be derived from its hash value. A given
specific input always results in the same hash value being computed.

Any modifications or alterations to transaction input — even the most
minuscule change — results in a different hash value being computed, which
indicates potentially compromised transaction input. Thus, the hash value can
be used to detect the integrity of the transaction input.
