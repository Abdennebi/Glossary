# Consensus Algorithms and Protocols

A consensus algorithm, does two things: it ensures that the next block in a
blockchain is the one and only version of the truth through agreement of
participants, and it keeps powerful adversaries from derailing the system and
successfully forking the chain. Some of the better known protocols are: Proof
of Work (Pow), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Activity (PoA), Proof of Burn (PoB),
Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Proof of Capacity (PoC).
