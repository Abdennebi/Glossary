# Confirmation

A confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the
network. This happens through a process known as mining, in a proof-of-work
system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed
or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it
becomes to perform a double spend attack.
