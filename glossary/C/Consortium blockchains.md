# Consortium blockchains

a consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is
controlled by a preselected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a
consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and
of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid. The right
to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and
there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being
public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a
limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts
of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered "partially
decentralized".
