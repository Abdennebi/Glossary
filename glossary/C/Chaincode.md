# Chaincode

Chaincode is the Hyperledger fabricâ€™s interpretation of the smart contract
method/algorithm, with additional features. Embedded logic that encodes the
rules for specific types of network transactions. Developers write chaincode
applications and deploy them to the network. End users then invoke
chaincode through a client-side application that interfaces with a network
peer, or node. Chaincode runs network transactions, which if validated, are
appended to the shared ledger and modify world state.
