# Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)

is an Intel technology for application developers who are seeking to protect
select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX makes such
protections possible through the use of enclaves, which are protected
areas of execution. Application code can be put into an enclave by special
instructions and software made available to developers via the IntelÂ® SGX
Software Development Kit (SDK). The Intel SGX SDK is a collection of APIs,
libraries, documentation, sample source code, and tools that allows software
developers to create and debug Intel SGX.
