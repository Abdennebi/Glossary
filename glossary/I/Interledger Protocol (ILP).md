# Interledger Protocol (ILP)

The Interledger Protocol provides for routing payments across different
digital asset ledgers while isolating senders and receivers from the risk of
intermediary failures. Secure multi-hop payments and automatic routing
enables a global network of networks for different types of value that can
connect any sender with any receiver.
