# Blockchain RTBF Risk

Due to the existence of multiple copies of the entire transaction database
it would be difficult to prove all data had been deleted. The fact that data
in the blockchain is immutable – which means that it cannot be altered or
removed once it has been entered – provides transparency and accountability.
However, it may also compromise privacy and data protection, especially when
it comes to personal or sensitive data (which should never be stored on a
blockchain). Blockchains do not guarantee anonymity and, the more personal
the data is, the easier it is to identify the individual to which it pertains. This
immutability may compromise the ‘right to be forgotten’, whereby users may,
under certain circumstances, demand that their personal data be erased.
