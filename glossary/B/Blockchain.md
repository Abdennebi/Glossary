# Blockchain

Originally block chain â€” is a distributed database that maintains a
continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block
contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By design blockchains are
inherently resistant to modification of the data â€” once recorded, the data in
a block cannot be altered retroactively. Blockchains are "an open, distributed
ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a
verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can also be programmed to
trigger transactions automatically.
