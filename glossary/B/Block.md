# Block

A group of transactions. Blocks typically have a reference to the previous block and that is how a "blockchain" is built. Blocks can also refer to blocks on other chains (e.g. a shard chain, a beacon chain). In many DLT/Blockchain systems mining is the proof of work activity that actually builds the blockchain.
