# Bitcoin Tumbler

Aka Bitcoin Mixer

randomly crisscrosses your bitcoins with other usersâ€™ bitcoins so that you get
a clean address that the blockchain cannot connect with any of the addresses
from which the coins were stolen. The tumbler is only accessible through the
anonymizing Tor network, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace traffic
to it or discover the people behind it.
