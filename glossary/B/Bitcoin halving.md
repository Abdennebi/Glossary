# Bitcoin halving

Bitcoins have a finite supply, which makes them a scarce digital commodity. The
total number of bitcoins that will ever be issued is 21 million. The number of bitcoins
generated per block (Block Reward) is decreased 50% every four years. This is called
"halving." Currently the reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. The next halving in 2020 will drop
the reward to 6.25 per block. The final halving will take place in the year 2140. The
countdown to the final halving can be monitored at http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/
