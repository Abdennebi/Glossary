# Bitcoin Vanity Address

is a customized variant of a normal Bitcoin address. The customization
occurs after the first character which is always 1. For example
1BITCOINanmgjh567bh457jj5tUyJgh5. Customization can be performed a
third party Vanity Address Issuer such as https://vante.me/#!/order/start.
However, research the 3rd Party issuer as some have been reported to be
scammers. Alternatively, software can be downloaded to a local computer so
that the Vanity Address can be self issued. Note that the computational effort
necessary to generate the address is significant. The BITCOIN Vanity Address
example above could take 1 week to generate.
