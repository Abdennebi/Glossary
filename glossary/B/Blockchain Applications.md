# Blockchain Applications

A blockchain application requires three interdependent components: the userfacing application, the smart contract, and the ledger.
The top layer is the user-facing application that meets the needs of the
network participants. The application lets users invoke smart contracts that
trigger transactions in the business network. The smart contract encapsulates
the business logic of the network: assets, ownership, and transfers. Each
invocation of a smart contract creates a transaction in the network and
updates the ledger. The ledger holds the current value of smart contract data
(for example, vehicleOwner=Daisy), and is distributed across the network.
