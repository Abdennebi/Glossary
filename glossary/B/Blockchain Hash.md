# Blockchain Hash

a hash function takes an input of any length and creates an output of fixed
length. The output is called a Hash. SHA256 is a hash function that takes any
length input and creates an output of 256 bits (32 bytes). A Blockchain Hash
is calculated for each block in a chain with the hash for the first block used as
input when calculating the hash for the next block.
