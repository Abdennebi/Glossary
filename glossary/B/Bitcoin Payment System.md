# Bitcoin Payment System

is peer-to-peer with transactions taking place between users directly,
without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes
and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which
uses bitcoin as its unit of account. Since the system works without a central
repository or single administrator, the U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a
decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency,
although prior systems existed and it is more correctly described as the first
decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of
total market value.
