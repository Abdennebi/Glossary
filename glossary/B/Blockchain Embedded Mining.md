# Blockchain Embedded Mining

Embedded mining is a relatively new concept where mining chips are
embedded into internet connected devices. In comparison to industrial grade
mining hardware (e.g. servers in a data center), embedded mining chips can
operate inside everyday devices such as a cell phone. Embedded mining
is speculated to be a solution to previously uneconomical efforts, such as
micropayments and monetizing the internet-of-things.
