# Blockchain Mining Hardware

CPU/GPU Bitcoin Mining: The least powerful category of bitcoin mining
hardware is your computer itself. Theoretically, you could use your computer’s
CPU to mine for bitcoins, but in practice, this is so slow by today’s standards
that there isn’t any point. You can enhance your bitcoin hash rate by adding
graphics hardware to your desktop computer. Graphics cards feature
graphical processing units (GPUs). These are designed for heavy mathematical
lifting so they can calculate all the complex polygons needed in high-end video
games. This makes them particularly good at the SHA hashing mathematics
necessary to solve transaction blocks. For example, an ATI 5970 graphics card
can give you over 800 MH/sec compared with a CPU, which will generally give
you less than 10 MH/sec.

FPGA Bitcoin Mining: A Field Programmable Gate Array is an integrated
circuit designed to be configured after being built. This enables a mining
hardware manufacturer to buy the chips in volume, and then customize them
for bitcoin mining before putting them into their own equipment. Because
they are customized for mining, they offer performance improvements over
CPUs and GPUs. Single-chip FPGAs have been seen operating at around 750
Megahashes/sec, although that’s at the high end.
ASIC Bitcoin Miners: This is where the action’s really at. Application Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are specifically designed to do just one thing: mine
bitcoins at mind-crushing speeds, with relatively low power consumption.
Because these chips have to be designed specifically for that task and then
fabricated, they are expensive and time-consuming to produce - but the
speeds are stunning. At the time of writing, units are selling with speeds
anywhere from 5-500 Gigahashes/sec (although actually getting some of them
to them to ship has been a problem).
