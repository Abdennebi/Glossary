# ZeroKnowledge Proofs

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a
method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the
verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart
from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
