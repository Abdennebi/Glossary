# ZkSNARK (Zeroknowledge Succinct Noninteractive Arguments of Knowledge)

are the cryptographic tools underlying Zcash (open, permissionless
cryptocurrency protecting privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge
cryptography). They are proofs that you have performed a computation over
some inputs without revealing all of the inputs. Zcash uses these proofs to
verify transactions while protecting usersâ€™ privacy.
