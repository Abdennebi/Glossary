# Front Running Attacks

Front running attacks are a common strategy for attackers to exploit information gaps or latencies and execute trades quickly in order to gain an advantage.

Some common strategies include monitoring public Mempools, public oracles and public exchanges and distributed exchanges to spot opportunities.

Defenses against front running typically involve reducing latency by moving trading systems closer to exchanges or putting them on high speed, low latency networks in the case of distributed exchanges, and running your own mining pool or miners in order to execute transactions without having to send them to the Mempool.
