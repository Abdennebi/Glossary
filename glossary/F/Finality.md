# Finality

Finality refers to a block being accepted in a blockchain such that it is valid and final. Some blockchains have probabilistic finality, that is a block is probably final, and as it gets older that probability rises (e.g. in Blockchain), some have absolute finality, that is once a block is accepted, it's accepted, and there is also economic finality, in which it becomes very expensive to revert a finalized bock.

Many attacks involve trying to abuse finality mechanisms or delay them so that attacker controlled blocks are treated as finalized.
