# Fork

a regular fork where all nodes follow the same consensus rules, so the fork
is resolved once one chain has more proof of work than another. When two
or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain. Typically
occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time. Can also
happen as part of an attack.
