# Trusted Stamping Authority (TSA)

a trusted third party that issues timestamps. These timestamps prove when
data existed (e.g. contracts, medical records, and prevents backdating by
the data’s owners. Blockchain does not need TSAs because transactions are
included in blocks which are generated every 10 minutes (on average) and
you get a block’s timestamp for all its transactions.
