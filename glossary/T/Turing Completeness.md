# Turing Completeness

A machine is Turing complete if it can perform any calculation that any other
programmable computer is capable of. All modern computers are Turingcomplete in this sense. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which runs on the
Ethereum blockchain is Turing complete. Thus, it can process any "computable
function". It is, in short, able to do what you could do with any conventional
computer and programming language.
