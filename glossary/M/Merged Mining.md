# Merged Mining

Merged mining is the process of allowing two different crypto currencies
based on the same algorithm to be mined simultaneously. This allows low
hash powered crypto currencies to increase the hashing power behind their
network by bootstrapping onto more popular crypto currencies. Two of the
best examples of this are scrypt mining of both litecoin and dogecoin, as well
as namecoin and bitcoin with sha-256.
