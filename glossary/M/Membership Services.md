# Membership Services

Membership Services manages user identities on a permissioned
blockchain network through the Certificate Authority peer. Membership
Services provides a distinction of roles by combining elements of Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) and decentralization (consensus). By contrast,
non-permissioned networks do not provide member-specific authority or a
distinction of roles.
A permissioned blockchain requires entities to register for long-term
identity credentials (Enrollment Certificates), which can be distinguished
according to entity type. For users, an Enrollment Certificate authorizes the
Transaction Certificate Authority (TCA) to issue pseudonymous credentials;
these certificates authorize transactions submitted by the user. Transaction
certificates persist on the blockchain, and enable authorized auditors to
associate otherwise unlinkable transactions.
