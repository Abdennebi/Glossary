# Unpermissioned (Permissionless) Ledgers

Unpermissioned ledgers such as Bitcoin have no single owner â€” indeed,
they cannot be owned. The purpose of an unpermissioned ledger is to allow
anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of
the ledger to have identical copies. This creates censorship resistance, which
means that no actor can prevent a transaction from being added to the ledger.
Participants maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about
its state dynamically in real-time.
