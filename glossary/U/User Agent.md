# User Agent

user agent fields embedded in the each nodeâ€™s software contain information
related to the version and codebase the nodes are using. These fields are
exchanged between 2 nodes anytime contact is made. By reading and
summarizing these fields for all nodes a conclusion can be reached regarding
the health of the network. For Example: Node 1: /Satoshi:5.64/bitcoin-qt:0.4/
Node 2: /Satoshi:5.12/Spesmilo:0.8/. Both nodes use the same protocol
version of Bitcoin software but they use different versions of the codebase.
