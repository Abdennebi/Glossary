# Distributed Database

database in which storage devices are not all attached to a common
processor. It may be stored in multiple computers, located in the same
physical location; or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected
computers. Unlike parallel systems, in which the processors are tightly coupled
and constitute a single database system, a distributed database system
consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components.
