# Distributed Ledger

(also called shared ledger or register) a consensus of replicated, shared,
and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites,
countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralized
data storage. A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus
algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken. One distributed
ledger design is through implementation of a public or private blockchain
system. But all distributed ledgers do not have to necessarily employ a chain
of blocks to successfully provide secure and valid achievement of distributed
consensus, a Blockchain is only one type of data structure considered to be
a distributed ledger.
