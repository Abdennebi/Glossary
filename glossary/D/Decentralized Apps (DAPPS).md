# Decentralized App (DAPP)

Decentralized App (DAPP) are a type of software program designed to exist on the Internet in a way that is
not controlled by any single entity. For an application to be considered a Dapp it
must meet the following criteria:
Application must be completely open-source - It must operate autonomously,
and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may
adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback
but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.
Application’s data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored - in
a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.
Application must use a cryptographic token - (bitcoin or a token native to its
system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of
value from (miners /farmers) should be rewarded in the application’s tokens.
Application must generate tokens - according to a standard cryptographic
algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application
(Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work Algorithm).
