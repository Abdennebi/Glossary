# DDoS Attack

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are the new normal as most systems are engineered such that a single system or denial of service attack can't take them down. Most DDoS attacks fall into two main categories: extortion and as an enabler for other attacks (e.g. a 51% attack by taking another mining pool offline).
