# Double Spending

Double spend refers to a scenario, in the Bitcoin network, where someone
tries to send a bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at the same time.

However, once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible
to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has,
the harder it becomes to double spend the bitcoins.
