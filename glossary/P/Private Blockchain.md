# Private Blockchain

a fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are
kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public
or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database
management, auditing, etc. internal to a single company, and so public
readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases
public auditability is desired.
