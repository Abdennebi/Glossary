# Peer-to-Peer Transaction Platforms

Peer-to-peer (P2P) refers to the decentralized interactions that happen
between at least two parties in a highly-interconnected network. P2P
participants deal directly with each other through a single mediation point.


Pegged Sidechains

is the creation of another blockchain to be used to transfer Bitcoins and
assets from one blockchain to another. Several advantage of Pegged
Sidechains are:
1. Access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets
they already own
2. More easily interoperate with each other and with Bitcoin
3. Avoiding the liquidity shortages and market fluctuations associated with
new currencies
4. Since sidechains are separate systems, technical and economic
innovation is not hindered
5. Despite bidirectional transferability between Bitcoin and pegged
sidechains, they are isolated:
a. in the case of a cryptographic break (or malicious design) in a
sidechain, the damage is entirely confined to the sidechain itself.
