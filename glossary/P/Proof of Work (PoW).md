# Proof-of-Work (PoW)

A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be
hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional
variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a
block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and
computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.
