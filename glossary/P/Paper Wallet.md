# Paper Wallet

A paper wallet stores the data needed to access a digital asset(s) by printing the cryptographic keys or recovery pass phrase out on paper, allowing the paper to be securely stored offline (e.g. in a safe). Paper wallets also provide protections against failures in digital devices (e.g. bit-rot in writable CDs/DVDs or USB keys/SD cards that fail after several years).
