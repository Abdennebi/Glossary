# Proof of Authority (PoA)

Proof-of-Authority is a replacement for Proof-of-Work, which can be used
for private chain setups. It does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily
difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a hard-configured set of
"authorities" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and
secure the blockchain. This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and
keep the block issuers accountable. A Proof of authority is a consensus
mechanism in a private blockchain which essentially gives one client (or a
specific number of clients) with one particular private key the right to make
all of the blocks in the blockchain.
