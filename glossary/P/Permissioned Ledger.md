# Permissioned Ledger

A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to
access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners.
When a new record is added, the ledgerâ€™s integrity is checked by a limited
consensus process. This is carried out by trusted actors which makes
maintaining a shared record much simpler that the consensus process
used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide
highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital
signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is usually
faster than an unpermissioned ledger.
