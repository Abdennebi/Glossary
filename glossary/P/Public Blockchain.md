# Public Blockchain

is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can
send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and
anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process
for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current
state is. As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public
blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic
incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of
work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which
someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional
to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These
blockchains are generally considered to be "fully decentralized".
