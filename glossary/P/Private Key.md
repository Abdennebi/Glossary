# Private Key

A private key is a string of data that shows you have access to bitcoins in a
specific wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password; private keys
must never be revealed to anyone but you, as they allow you to spend the
bitcoins from your bitcoin wallet through a cryptographic signature.
