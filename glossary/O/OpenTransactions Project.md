# OpenTransactions Project

This is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade,
fully-featured, free-software toolkit implementing the OTX protocol as
well as a full-strength financial cryptography library, API, GUI, commandline interface, and prototype notary server. The project is managed
by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to
communicate, plan, and develop the Open-Transactions toolkit and its
related documentation.
