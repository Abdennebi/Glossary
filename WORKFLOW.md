# Workflow for adding to and generating the glossary

Files are named as the glossary term they represent, e.g. "Hash Function" would be "Hash Function.md". Any acronym should be spelled out first and then included in parentheses such as "Know Your Customer (KYC).md".

The files live in the "glossary/[first character of filename]/" directories.

Please see [glossary-entry-template.md](glossary-entry-template.md) for an example entry and formatting.

## Creating a new entry

Simply fork the repo and create a Pull Request (PR) with the new term, it should ideally be self explanatory and clearly aligned with the glossary, if not we may ask questions to determine if it is suitable (e.g. vendor specific content is generally not encouraged in the glossary).

## Updating an existing entry

Simply fork the repo and create a Pull Request (PR) with the updated information, it should ideally be self explanatory and clearly aligned with the glossary, if not we may ask questions to determine if it is suitable (e.g. vendor specific content is generally not encouraged in the glossary).

## GitHub Workflow

Please clone this repository, you can then make changes to your copy and submit PR's (pull requests).
