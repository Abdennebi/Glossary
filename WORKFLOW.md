# Workflow for adding to and generating the glossary

Files are named as the glossary term they represent, e.g. "Hash Function" would be "Hash Function.md"

Formatting of the file is simply a header with the term and then content at this time.

The files live in the "glossary/[first character]/" directories.

Please see [glossary-entry-template.md](glossary-entry-template.md) for an example entry.
